# What?

[This repository](https://github.com/rogiersbart/mnemosyne) archives the training materials I put together for GUI-based groundwater modelling
with open source USGS software
([ModelMuse](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modelmuse-a-graphical-user-interface-groundwater-models), [MODFLOW](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/modflow-and-related-programs)
and friends). The currently archived materials are the following:

[IAH Belgium](https://belgium.iah.org/) Education evenings **2016**:<br>
**Practical introduction to groundwater modelling.**<br>
Computer exercises (3 x 1.5h sessions; see folder `/2016_iah-belgium_pitgm/`).<br>

[IAH Belgium](https://belgium.iah.org/) Education evenings **2018**:<br>
**Practical introduction to groundwater modelling.**<br>
Computer exercises (3 x 1.5h sessions; see folder `/2018_iah-belgium_pitgm/`).<br>

[IAH Belgium](https://belgium.iah.org/) Education evenings **2020**:<br>
Solving everyday groundwater problems with numerical 3D models.<br>
**A brief introduction to ModelMuse** (45 min presentation; see folder `/2020_iah-belgium_abitm/`).<br>

# The repo name?

> In ancient Greece and Rome, the Muses were thought, by some, to provide the
inspiration for music, poetry, and the arts. The composers, poets, and other
artists, however, still had to do the hard work of turning that inspiration into
an actual work of art. It would be great if ModelMuse could do the same for
modelersâ€”provide the key insight required to allow the system to be quickly and
effectively modeled. ModelMuse can not do that; it is not smart enough. What it
can do is take over some of the mundane parts of the modeling process and make
them much easier and faster. By doing so, ModelMuse allows the modeler more time
to think, to observe, to analyze, to experiment, and to generate the needed
inspiration. -- [Richard B. Winston](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/tm6A29/tm6A29.pdf)

Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses.
